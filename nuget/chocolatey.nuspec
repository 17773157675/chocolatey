    <summary>Chocolatey is your machine level NuGet repository. Think apt-get for Windows (executables/application packages), not library packages.</summary>
    <description>
Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows (like apt-get but for Windows). It was designed to be a decentralized framework for quickly installing applications and tools that you need. It is built on the NuGet infrastructure currently using PowerShell as its focus for delivering packages from the distros to your door, err computer.

You can host your own sources and add them to chocolatey, you can extend chocolatey's capabilities, and folks, it's only going to get better.

== Commands ==
There are quite a few commands you can call - you should check out the command reference at: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsReference

    Search - choco search something
    List - choco list -lo
    Install - choco install baretail
    Update - choco update baretail
    Uninstall - choco uninstall baretail

More advanced commands and switches listed on the command reference, including how you can force a package to install the x86 version of a package.

== Create Packages? ==
We have some great guidance on how to do that. Where? I'll give you a hint, it rhymes with sticky! https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages

In that mess there is a link to the Helper Reference - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/HelpersReference

== Chocolatey gods? ==
Humor related to playing off of tiki gods. We like humor. Don't take life so seriously, you will never get out alive.
